# GARTS
Genetic Algorithm Real-Time Strategy (Hons)
Created by Samuel Cumming.

GARTS aims to test if replayability and player enjoyment can be enhanced by AI RTS opponents
that are enhanced by genetic algorithms, compared to normal, rules-based AIs.

This project is open-source, and you may freely engage in continuing the research, using Appollo or
modifying GARTS in a separate fork.

Appollo is a custom built framework designed for GARTS. It uses SDL2.0 as a back-end.
